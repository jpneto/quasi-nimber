## Quasi-nimbers

This repository includes Python code to compute the lists of unsafe nimbers described in article "Disjunctive Sums of Quasi-nimbers".

The algorithm assumes, as stated in the paper, that given two lists <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{L}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{R}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(\mathbf{L}'\subsetneq \mathbf{L},\mathbf{R}'\subsetneq \mathbf{R})"> are irreducible.

Available code:

+ `quasi_nimber.py` includes all the necessary code to compute game values 

+ `examples.py` contains some use examples

+ `A066998.py` is a generator that estimates a proportion of the number of operations needed for n cards

If you do not have Python installed, it's possible to run the main script online, like in [https://repl.it/languages/python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3)
